## The Project's Overview

- The goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio website on github.io using their cloud hosting service. We were to put our resume information on there, as well as use different JavaScrip tools and web API's to supplement our learning of the subject. We also used cookies to remembers users if they have logged into the site before, and welcome them if not.

## General Requirements

- For this I took a look at my resume and copied a lot of what I had written down into the respective areas of the website. I also provided a link to the ``waph.html`` page where I gave an overview of the course.

## Non-technical Requirements

- I found a Bootstrap repository with a good resume template and transferred that into ``index.html``. I implemented both the Google and flag page trackers because I thought they were interesting. I did that just by following the instructions on their respective websites.

## Technical Requirements

- For the basic JS code I imported all of our widgets from lab 2 and integrated them as best I could into the website. I also included the joke API at the top and the CaaS (Cats as a Service) API at the bottom of the page. CaaS was tricky because I had to figure out how to convert an image in such a way that it was able to be displayed. To make the joke refresh every minute I used the ``setInterval()`` function. For the JavaScript cookies I took the code from the w3schools page and modified it slightly to be a little more personalized for my website visitors.
